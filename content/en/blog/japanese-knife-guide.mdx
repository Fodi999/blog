# Japanese Kitchen Knives: Complete Guide

Japanese knives are not just tools, they are works of art created through centuries of tradition.

<ChefTip>
Never wash Japanese knives in a dishwasher! Hand wash only and dry immediately.

## Knife Care

<ChefTip>
Sharpen knives regularly on whetstones #1000, #3000, #6000 for perfect sharpness.
</ChefTip>

### Storage Rules

1. **Magnetic strip** — best option
2. **Wooden block** — good alternative
3. **Drawer with protection** — if no other options

❌ **Never:**
- Don't throw knives in the sink
- Don't cut on glass cutting boards
- Don't leave wet

## Sharpening

Japanese knives require a special approach to sharpening.

```
Sharpening angle: 15-17° (European knives: 20-22°)
Stones: #1000 → #3000 → #6000 → #8000
```

<ChefTip>
For beginners, I recommend starting with #1000 stone. It's a universal stone for basic sharpening.

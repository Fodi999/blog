The true purpose of understanding Japanese cuisine is not to master a fixed set of recipes to follow without question. The real goal is to learn to cook in an authentically Japanese spirit — to feel the clarifying and ordering influence that Japanese tradition brings to food itself. This is the art of Japanese cooking: to reveal the soul of the kitchen, to understand its fundamental methods, not merely to share individual recipes.

The main goal of Japanese cuisine is not to complicate, but to purify. Not to saturate with spices, but to highlight the natural flavour of the ingredient. Not to impress with scale — but to create harmony.

## 1. The Structure of a Japanese Meal: The Logic of "Soup + Three"

In Western culture we are accustomed to the concept of a "main course" — the centre of the plate, around which the garnish and sauce are arranged. In Japanese tradition the logic is fundamentally different.

The basic model is called **ichiju sansai** — literally "soup and three dishes". The traditional sequence, which in Japanese is called *ichiju sansai*, or "soup+3", involves three main dishes in the following order:

1. Fresh raw fish (*sashimi*)
2. A grilled or pan-fried dish (*yakimono*)
3. A boiled or simmered dish (*nimono*)

These are the dishes typically served to guests at home, followed naturally by steamed rice, pickles and tea, and often fresh fruit.

    <div className="text-muted-foreground text-sm">simmered and braised — completing the hot courses</div>
  </div>
</div>

At the end, the following are always served simultaneously: **rice** (gohan), **miso soup** (miso-shiru), **pickles** (tsukemono), **green tea** (ryokucha) and fresh fruit. This is not a rigid dogma, but a principle of balance to be followed freely, guided by the spirit of Japanese cooking.

## 2. The Difference from the Western Gastronomic Model

The basic "formula of three" is not very different from the typical Western "main course", which usually consists of fish or meat, fried potatoes and boiled vegetables. The key difference is that in the West this "trio" is served on a single large plate, whereas in Japan it is served on separate small dishes, cups and bowls.

The Japanese custom of serving dishes on individual plates emphasises the importance they place on appearance. No Japanese person, no matter how modest their means, would think of serving all the food on one plate, assuming that taste alone is sufficient to please the guest. On the contrary, every Japanese dish is an **artistic composition**, in which the tableware, the food and its arrangement are chosen to complement one another to the greatest effect.

A meal as a whole is also a composition — a symphony of carefully considered flavours, aromas, colours and textures appropriate to the time of year.

  <span className="block mb-2 text-foreground">Grilled dishes come before steamed, steamed before boiled. The formal banquet structure runs: opening (dzensai appetisers, clear soup, sashimi), middle (yakimono, mushimono, nimono, agemono, sunomono), finale (rice, miso, pickles, tea, fruit).</span>

## 3. The Core Principle: Do Not Overcook

Japanese food is prepared from fresh or lightly heat-treated ingredients. Its foundation is seasonal produce, cooked to enhance natural flavour. "Do not overcook" is the principle to which enormous attention is paid in Japanese cookery.

As a result, fish cooked in the Japanese manner flakes apart yet remains juicy; the meat of a chicken near the bone is pink; vegetables are slightly crisp. The principal Japanese seasonings — soy sauce and dashi stock from bonito — have a very delicate aroma. They are added to almost every dish, but sparingly, so as not to mask the natural aromas of the ingredients.

**Japanese food is light and low in fat.** One of the most popular Japanese cooking methods is very brief boiling, which does not destroy the original flavour of the ingredients. When deep-frying, great attention is paid to the temperature of the oil: it is selected so that the product absorbs as little fat as possible. The oil must be hot enough to seal the surface of whatever is submerged in it, but must not penetrate inside — the natural juices must be preserved within. This is why properly prepared *tempura* is a very light dish.

## 4. Fish as the Central Element of Japanese Cuisine

Fish appears on the Japanese menu far more often than beef or pork. This is logical: Japan is a country with very little land, a group of mountainous islands washed by fish-rich ocean currents. Fish in Japan is served so splendidly fresh that nothing "fishy" remains in it.

Fresh fish — with clear, unclouded eyes and firm, glistening scales — has a more delicate texture than red meat and possesses a subtle, clean "oceanic" taste. Fresh fish served as *sashimi* is not only delicious but also low-calorie food, low in carbohydrates and high in protein.

<Callout type="warning">
Clear soup and sashimi are the *chefs d'oeuvre*, the true measure of a cook's mastery. In gastronomic language this combination is called *wan-sashi* — from *wan* ("soup bowl") and *sashi* (short for sashimi). These two dishes are how professional skill is judged.
</Callout>

*Sashimi* — raw fish, unprocessed by heat — is effectively the face of any meal offered to guests. In a lacquer soup bowl you are first presented with a delightful small "still life" of seafood and vegetables in a crystal-clear broth — a genuine delight for both eye and palate. Following that, on the finest plates, comes an equally beautiful composition of masterfully sliced pieces of the freshest fish fillet with an artistically executed garnish. Instead of porcelain or ceramics, sashimi is often served on a plain flat piece of fragrant wood with a fine grain, beautiful in its natural simplicity, with one or two leaves in place of a garnish.

## 5. Sake: Its Role in the Meal

At a formal dinner, sake is served at the very beginning; the toast is usually made before the guests have touched the appetisers. Sake is then refilled throughout the meal until steamed rice is served. Sake is not drunk with soups, which are served very hot.

Sake is served moderately warm. It is sipped in small amounts between mouthfuls of warm or cold food to refresh the palate and heighten enjoyment of the temperature contrasts between dishes. As for sake and rice, the two are not close companions — since sake is made from rice, the two products do not enhance each other's flavour.

## 6. The Two Rules of Harmony

To achieve harmony in the Japanese spirit there are two rules.

**First:** no single ingredient is used twice in one meal. If, for example, tempura is the centrepiece, do not use prawns in the appetisers, clear soup or dressed salad.

**Second:** give each dish the opportunity to present the guest with a different cooking technique. This is the principle behind "soup+3". If you plan to serve more than three main dishes, different methods must be used for their preparation; methods already employed must not be repeated.

<div className="text-xl md:text-2xl font-black text-primary my-6 italic border-l-4 border-primary pl-6 py-4 bg-primary/5 rounded-r-2xl">
  In the West, too, great attention is paid to flavour balance — dishes are combined so that they are in harmony with one another. But tableware in the West is most often used in matching sets, designed to serve the meal as a whole, so the choice of vessel does not enter into individual gastronomic compositions.
</div>

In the Japanese meal, a great variety of tableware is used — not uniform, identically decorated sets. This is precisely what allows each dish to breathe independently while remaining connected to the overall ensemble of the table.

## 7. Seasonal Delicacies: Dzensai Appetisers

Appetisers (*dzensai*) are usually seasonal delicacies — attractively presented and served in microscopic portions. They may be prepared from fish (smoked salmon, for example) or other seafood (raw prawns, sea urchin, squid). Vegetables such as cucumber or lotus root are sliced into rounds or pieces. Chestnuts or ginkgo nuts also make fine dzensai.

It is worth noting that the Japanese meal has no sweet dessert as understood in the West, though fresh fruit is occasionally served at the end. A cup of clear green tea sometimes accompanies *okashi* (Japanese sweets) designed to set off the slight bitterness of the tea — nothing like the chocolate-coated wafers served in the West beside a small cup of coffee.

## 8. Professional Mastery and the Home Cook

The professional Japanese chef effectively has countless hands — those of assistants preparing many courses, each distinguished by an extraordinarily clean flavour, served at the right moment, and constituting an example of genuine artistic achievement.

Recipes prepared in the Japanese spirit are sized for portions somewhat larger than those served in Japan itself. Such a portion will be sufficient if you decide to prepare one Japanese dish alongside European food; in other situations it may seem small.

  <span className="block font-bold text-lg text-primary mb-2">Advice When Starting with Japanese Cooking</span>
  <span className="block mb-2 text-foreground">When studying Japanese cuisine, it is generally recommended to introduce one Japanese dish into a European meal at a time. One of the first steps in mastering Japanese cookery is preparing dishes in a shared vessel directly at the dining table — as Japanese people frequently do. This approach is also excellent for beginners.</span>

Seasonality is not marketing or trend. It is a philosophy of respect for nature and for the guest. A Japanese cook would never serve a summer dish in winter — not because it is forbidden, but because it contradicts the very spirit of Japanese cuisine.
</Callout>

## 9. A Philosophical Conclusion

Japanese cuisine is a mindful balance between textures, colours, aromas, the freshness of seasonal produce and the overall appearance of dishes. It is not a culinary scheme to be followed literally — it is a way of thinking about food, about the ingredient, about the season and about the guest.

Bearing in mind the typical Japanese sequence of courses, one may nonetheless feel entirely free to use recipes in the Japanese spirit as one sees fit. What matters is to remember the spirit of Japanese cuisine, in which the greatest importance is given to **a creatively considered balance** between textures, colours, aromas, the freshness of seasonal ingredients and the overall appearance of dishes.

Japanese cuisine does not aim to impress with scale. It aims to create harmony. And this is precisely why it remains one of the most intellectual and simultaneously most honest cuisines in the world — a cuisine where respect for the ingredient is the supreme value.

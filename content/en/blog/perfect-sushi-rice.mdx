Sushi rice is the foundation, not a side dish. In Japanese cuisine, rice defines texture, balance, and flavor purity. Even perfect fish won't shine if the rice is done wrong.

In this article, I'll approach the topic professionally: first **what sushi rice is**, then **technique**, then **equipment**, and only after that — **the base recipe** (as technology application).

<ChefTip>
💡 **Chef's Tip:** Sushi rice should be neither hot nor cold — the goal is **warm rice around 36°C** (body temperature).
</ChefTip>

## Understanding Sushi Rice

For sushi, use **Japanese short-grain rice** (sushi rice / japonica). It provides the needed stickiness, but with proper cooking, each grain remains distinct: rice holds its shape, doesn't turn mushy, and doesn't "flow."

The result depends on:
- variety and producer;
- rice freshness (new harvest requires less water);
- quality of washing and drying;
- heat stability and "finishing" without fire.

## Cooking Technique: Principles (No "Magic")

This is the key section. **Principles** matter here, not formulas.

### 1) Washing

Rice is washed not for "cleanliness" but to remove surface starch and dust after polishing. Water first becomes "milky" — that's normal.

How to do it right:
- wash with cold water 4–6 times;
- don't let rice sit in cloudy water — drain immediately;
- goal: water **almost clear**, not perfectly "like glass."

### 2) Drying

After washing, rice needs to **dry for 15–30 minutes** in a colander. This stabilizes the grain and helps achieve even texture after cooking.

### 3) Water

There's no universal formula. But a working rule for home and professional kitchens:
- there should be enough water for rice to cook evenly,
- but not so much that grains lose structure.

Practically:
- consider variety, freshness, and how actively you washed;
- better slightly less than too much (excess water is texture's main enemy).

### 4) Heat and "Rest"

Rice is cooked **under a tightly closed lid** and **the lid isn't opened**.

Basic logic:
1. bring to a boil;
2. reduce heat to minimum and cook;
3. remove from heat and let rice **rest 15–20 minutes** under the lid.

The "rest" stage isn't optional — it's part of the technology.

## Equipment and Tools: Why It Matters

Equipment doesn't replace technique but supports it.

**For cooking:**
- **heavy pot** with thick bottom;
- **tight-fitting lid** (to retain steam);
- rice cooker — excellent tool if you understand the process logic.

**For mixing and cooling:**
- **wooden spatula (shamoji)** — doesn't damage grains;
- wide container (traditionally **hangiri**) helps bring rice to target temperature faster.

**Critical Control Points:**

- Timer at stages 2, 5, 6 — mandatory
- Don't open lid at stages 4, 5, 6
- Target temperature of finished rice: ~36°C (body temperature)
</Callout>

## Professional Tips

<Callout type="tip">
- Use only **Japanese short-grain** rice
- **Stick to one rice brand** — each variety behaves differently, consistency starts with product consistency
- **Cook by timer** — not "by eye." Precise cooking and "rest" time is the foundation of repeatable results
- Don't reheat sushi rice — structure breaks down
- Target temperature: **warm rice ~36°C**
- Don't open lid while cooking (breaks steam mode)
- If rice is slightly firmer — that's easier to fix than overcooked
</Callout>

## Common Mistakes

**❌ Too much water**  
Rice becomes mushy, heavy, harder to shape.

**❌ Opened lid during cooking**  
Breaks steam mode, rice cooks unevenly.

**❌ Weak/wrong seasoning**  
No characteristic "sushi taste," rice seems flat.

**❌ Cold rice**  
Poor plasticity, unpleasant mouthfeel.

## Conclusion

Perfect sushi rice is the result of understanding the process: washing, drying, steam mode, "rest," and proper seasoning. Master this basic technology, and you'll elevate everything — from simple maki to nigiri and signature rolls.

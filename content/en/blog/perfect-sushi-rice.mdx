Sushi rice is the foundation of any great sushi. Without properly prepared rice, even the best fish won't shine. This is a skill that requires practice, patience, and understanding of Japanese culinary philosophy.

<ChefTip>
💡 **Chef's Advice:** Sushi rice should never be hot or cold — ideally lukewarm, around 36°C (body temperature).

## Ingredients

- 2 cups Japanese short-grain rice
- 2.5 cups water
- 1/4 cup rice vinegar
- 2 tablespoons sugar
- 1 teaspoon salt

## Preparation Steps

### 1. Washing the Rice

The key to success is thoroughly rinsing the rice. Wash it with cold water until the water runs clear. This process removes excess starch and prevents the rice from being too sticky.

### 2. Cooking

Cook the rice using a 1.25:1 water-to-rice ratio. Use a heavy-bottomed pot or rice cooker. After bringing to a boil, reduce heat and cook covered for 15 minutes.

### 3. Seasoning

Mix rice vinegar, sugar, and salt until the sugar dissolves. Gently fold into the hot rice using a "cutting" motion with a spatula.

## Pro Tips

- Use only Japanese short-grain rice
- Never reheat sushi rice
- Serving temperature: around 36°C (body temperature)
- Rice should be slightly glossy but not wet

## Common Mistakes

❌ **Too much water**  
Rice becomes mushy and loses structure

❌ **Too little vinegar**  
Lack of characteristic sushi flavor

❌ **Cold rice**  
Difficult to shape, unpleasant taste

❌ **Rinsing after cooking**  
Flavor and seasoning wash away

## In Development
**v1.0.0 • B2B SaaS • Solo Builder**

### RestaurantAI
**B2B SaaS platform for restaurants** that I'm developing as a chef and engineer, combining inventory, recipes, dishes, menu engineering, and AI recommendations into a unified profit management system.

<ChefTip>
Simple goal: restaurants should make decisions based on numbers, not "feelings".
</ChefTip>

## The Problem I See Every Day

Working in restaurants, I've repeatedly encountered the same problems:

- ✗ Food Cost calculated in Excel  
- ✗ Real losses go unnoticed  
- ✗ Unclear which dishes drag profit down  
- ✗ Decisions made on "gut feeling"  
- ✗ Problems discovered too late  
- ✗ No systematic data control  

<Callout type="warning">
Restaurants live in chaos of numbers, while money is lost quietly and gradually.
</Callout>

## How RestaurantAI Works

RestaurantAI solves these problems **systematically** — from product tracking to specific AI recommendations.

The platform is designed as a unified logical system, not a collection of disconnected tools.

---

## 1. Inventory

You know exactly:
- what's in stock  
- how much it costs  
- when it expires  

**Features:**
- product tracking by categories  
- expiration date control with warnings  
- real-time stock levels  
- unified ingredient database  
- no Excel and "approximate numbers"  

<ChefTip>
Inventory Management System — foundation of all calculations.
</ChefTip>

---

## 2. Recipes

Recipes are calculated **based on inventory**, not "in your head".

**Capabilities:**
- automatic cost calculation  
- portions, weight, yield  
- warnings about problematic ingredients  
- unified recipe database  

The system handles calculations, freeing time for chefs and managers.

---

## 3. Menu Engineering

Classic Menu Engineering, but automated.

RestaurantAI shows:

<Callout type="info">
- ⭐ **Star** — promote  
- 🟢 **Cash Cow** — keep as is  
- 🟡 **Question** — optimize  
- 🔴 **Dog** — remove from menu  
</Callout>

No tables and guesswork — only clear decisions.

---

## 4. AI Recommendations

RestaurantAI doesn't just display data — **it suggests what to do**.

### Example recommendation:
<ChefTip>
"Use expiring cream in 2 dishes — save 120 PLN"
</ChefTip>

AI suggestions:
- always tied to money  
- show effect in PLN  
- help reduce waste and increase profit  

---

## Why It Works

- ✔ Project created by **one chef and developer**  
- ✔ I know kitchens from inside and understand real operations  
- ✔ Solutions tested in restaurants, not presentations  
- ✔ Money at the center of every feature  
- ✔ All business logic and calculations on server  

<Callout type="tip">
Not a startup with dozens of managers. A tool built by a practitioner for practitioners.
</Callout>

---

## Who It's For

RestaurantAI is for those who want to **control numbers, not guess**:

- medium-sized restaurants  
- cafes with full kitchens  
- cloud kitchens  
- gastronomic projects  

---

## Results the System Delivers

- 📉 lower Food Cost  
- 📈 profit growth  
- ❌ fewer write-offs  
- ⏱ time savings  
- 📊 control in one place  

---

## What's Next

RestaurantAI is in active development. Future versions will enhance automation, analytics, and AI decision support.

If this approach resonates with you — stay tuned for updates.
